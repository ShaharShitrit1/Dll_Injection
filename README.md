# Dll_Injection
This project is about injecting into NotePad using my own DLL, 
But I added an option to inject my DLL into every application like Chrome for Example. The DLL will pop a Text Box on the screen every time the application tries to process something, 
For example: creating a new tab, or trying to save A file.
