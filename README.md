# Dll_Injection
This project is about injecting into NotePad using my own DLL, 
But I added an option to inject my DLL into every aplication like Chrome for Exampel.
The DLL will pop a Text Box on the screen every time the aplication tries to process something,
For example: creating new tab, or tring to save A file.
